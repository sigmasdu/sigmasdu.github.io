## School Overview

2024年度隐私计算前沿讲习暑期学校共包含两门课程：《安全多方计算选讲》（SQ0461049H）与《密码隐私数据处理选讲》（SQ046104EH），分别由Hong-ShengZhou、willySusilo、MarkManulis三位教授联合讲授。

《安全多方计算选讲》课程涵盖加密（CPA/CCA）算法和签名算法介绍、安全 性定义和可证明安全；承诺、零知识证明、不经意传输协议；安全两方计算中GARBLEDCIRCUIT、YAO协议等；通用可组合安全模型等内容。

《密码隐私数据处理选讲》课程分为Part Ⅰ与Part Ⅱ两大板块。作为安全多 方计算板块的关联课程，Part Ⅰ公钥密码学及应用：包括承诺、签名、不经意 传输等，Part Ⅱ为基于密码技术的隐私数据处理，包括秘密共享、同态加密、隐私集合求交以及可搜索加密等。

本课程为中阶难度课程，具有密码学基础的同学均可选课：

1. 来自VirginiaCommonwealthUniversity、UniversityofWollongong、UniversitatderBundeswehrMiinchen的三位教授全英授课。
2. 课程内容涵盖安全多方计算与密码隐私数据处理的最新研究成果和实际应用，并结合了国外大学原版课程与最新学术成果。
3. 结课后将获得山东大学暑期学校结课证书。

## School Lectures

### Professor Hong-Sheng Zhou

Hong - Sheng Zhou is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Commonwealth University. He was a postdoc at Maryland Cybersecurity Center under the direction of Jonathan Katz. Before that, he received his PhD at theUniversity of Connecticut with Aggelos Kiayias as advisor. Hong-Sheng is interested in a wide range of topics in moderncryptography including Secure Multi - Party Computation, Blockchain Technologies, Zero-Knowledge Proofs and many more.He investigates cryptographic primitives and protocols in the complex environments aiming to achieve strong securityguarantees including Composability, Leakage/Tampering/Subversion Resilience, Coercion Resilience, Fairness and QuantumResilience. He has published a number of papers in top cryptography, security and distributed computing conferences, suchas CRYPTO,EUROCRYPT, ASIACRYPT, ACM CCS,USENIX Security, and ACM PODC. Hong-Sheng was a recipient of an NSFComputing Innovation Fellowship and a Google Faculty Research Award. His research has been funded by NSF and mutipleindustry research gifts.

### Professor Mark Manulis

Dr. Mark Manulis is full professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Universität der Bundeswehr München. Since 2022 he is a member of the Research Institute CODE where he heads the PACY lab for Privacy and Applied Cryptography. His research is on privacy-enhancing technologies underpinned by modern cryptographic methods and techniques. His publication track record includes some 100 peer-reviewed publications in leading international security venues. He received Best Paper awards from ISC 2016 and InTrust 2014. He was program chair of ISC 2018 and ACNS 2016, general chair of CANS 2012 and PKC 2012, workshop chair at ESORICS 2020, and organiser of the Dagstuhl-Seminar on Privacy-Oriented Cryptography in 2012. He is associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security and Springer's International Journal of Information Security, and is an active member of IACR and IEEE.

### Professor Willy Susilo

Willy Susilo is a Distinguished Professor in the School of Computing and Information Technology, Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences at the University of Wollongong (UOW), Australia. He is the director of Institute of Cybersecurity and Cryptology, School of Computing and Information Technology, UOW and the Head of School of Computing and Information Technology at UOW. He is an IEEE Fellow, an IET Fellow, an ACS fellow and an AAIA fellow. He has been awarded the most prestigious Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship in 2023. Previously, he was awarded a prestigious Australian Research Council Future Fellowship in 2009. In 2016, he was awarded the "Researcher of the Year at UOW. He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Elsevier's Computer Standards and Interfaces and the MDPI s Information journal. He is currently an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, ACM Computing Surveys and Elsevier's Computers and Security. He has also served as the program committee member of several international conferences.
