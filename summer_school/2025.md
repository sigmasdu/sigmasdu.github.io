<!-- # 2025山东大学隐私增强计算前沿讲习 -->

## School Overview

2025年度隐私计算前沿讲习暑期学校共包含两门课程：《安全多方计算选讲》（SQ0461049H）与《密码隐私数据处理选讲》（SQ046104EH），分别由Feng Hao、Willy Susilo、Mark Manulis、Fuchun Guo四位教授联合讲授。

《安全多方计算选讲》课程涵盖加密（CPA/CCA）算法和签名算法介绍、安全 性定义和可证明安全；承诺、零知识证明、不经意传输协议；安全两方计算中GARBLEDCIRCUIT、YAO协议等；通用可组合安全模型等内容。

《密码隐私数据处理选讲》课程分为Part Ⅰ与Part Ⅱ两大板块。作为安全多 方计算板块的关联课程，Part Ⅰ公钥密码学及应用：包括承诺、签名、不经意 传输等，Part Ⅱ为基于密码技术的隐私数据处理，包括秘密共享、同态加密、隐私集合求交以及可搜索加密等。

本课程为中阶难度课程，具有密码学基础的同学均可选课：

1. 来自University of Wollongong、Universität der Bundeswehr München Neubiberg的四位教授全英授课。
2. 课程内容涵盖安全多方计算与密码隐私数据处理的最新研究成果和实际应用，并结合了国外大学原版课程与最新学术成果。
3. 结课后将获得山东大学暑期学校结课证书。
